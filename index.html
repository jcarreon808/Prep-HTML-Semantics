		<p>Once upon a time there was a huge old castle hidden deep in a forest. Next to the castle there was a giant mountain, which had a special cave. The cave was the home of a dragon called Diamond. One day she came down to the castle and was attacked by the castle’s knights. She knocked down all the walls by slamming it with her big tail and smashed the castle to the ground. <br>
			The King and Queen, who lived in that castle, where protected by one knight known as the Dragon Slayer. He was the bravest knight of all. To protect the king and queen, he jumped on the dragon’s back and stabbed it with his sword until Diamond was dead. He had killed Diamond the king’s dragon. What he did not know, was that she was trying to find the king, because she hadn’t seen him in years. She needed to inform him that she had an egg hidden under a rock in the cave that she wanted to give to him. He needed to look after it as it is very special.
